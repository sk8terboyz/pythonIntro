Welcome to the README page.

I put all of the homework problems into one file and created a menu for the user
to interact with. Just start the program by typing into the console "python hw1.py".

This will prompt you with the option to test question 1, 2, or 3. Select the proper
number for the question you would like to test.

For question 1, it accepts any input from the first question, and the second prompt
will clarify what responses it expects. If it receives any response other than what
is expected, it will let you know.

For question 2, it accepts the integer of the temperature in Fahrenheit, and outputs
it in Celsius.

For question 3, it accepts any integer/float inputs for a and b, and will output c to
2 decimal places.
